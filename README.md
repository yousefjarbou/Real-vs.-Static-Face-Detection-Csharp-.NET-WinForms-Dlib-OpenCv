# Real vs. Static Face Detection C#-.NET-WinForms-Dlib-OpenCv

This project was developed as part of my internship at **SEDCO** during the summer of 2024. It is a **C# .NET Windows application** designed to differentiate between a **real person** and a **static image** using webcam-based face detection. The system enhances security for facial recognition applications by verifying user **liveness** through **eye-blink detection**.

To make this feature reusable, I converted the application into a **DLL**, allowing easy integration into other projects. The function, when called, opens a camera window for a short time, processes the live feed, and then **returns a boolean value** (`true` for a real person, `false` for a static image). This modular design enables seamless incorporation into various security and authentication systems.

This DLL was successfully **integrated into my main project** during the internship‚Äî**[Zain Service App C#-.NET-WinForms-Dlib-OpenCv-XML-SQL SEDCO](https://github.com/yousefjarbou/Zain-Service-App-Csharp-.NET-WinForms-Dlib-OpenCv-XML-SQL-SEDCO)**.

## üîπ Features

- **Real vs. Static Face Detection**
  - Detects if a face is **real** or a **photo** using **blink detection**.
  - Uses **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)** for accurate liveness detection.
  - Works in **real-time** with a built-in **time-out mechanism**.

- **DLL for Easy Integration**
  - The detection module is implemented as a **standalone DLL**.
  - When the function is called, it opens the webcam and processes the face in real-time.
  - After the time-out, it **returns `true` or `false`**, making it adaptable to various applications.

- **Advanced Computer Vision Techniques**
  - **DlibDotNet**: Landmark detection for eye tracking.
  - **OpenCvSharp**: Image processing and real-time frame analysis.
  - **Blink Counting Algorithm**: Differentiates real users from photos or deepfakes.

- **Scalability & Code Flexibility**
  - The project follows **good OOP principles** such as:
    - **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module handles one specific task.
    - **Open-Closed Principle**: The system is **extensible** without modifying existing code.
  - This ensures **easy maintainability** and future upgrades.

## üìù How It Works

1. **Face Detection & Eye Tracking**
   - The webcam captures frames, and **Dlib** detects the facial landmarks.
   - It **calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)** to monitor blinking.

2. **Blink-Based Liveness Verification**
   - If blinking is detected within the **time-out window**, the system confirms a **real person**.
   - If no blinks are detected, the system **flags the face as static**.

3. **DLL Functionality**
   - Calling the DLL **opens a camera window** and starts the detection.
   - After the time-out, it **returns a boolean**:
     - ‚úÖ **True** ‚Üí Real person detected.
     - ‚ùå **False** ‚Üí Static image detected.
